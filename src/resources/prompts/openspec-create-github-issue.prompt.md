---

Please create a GitHub issue for the OpenSpec change described in the provided files.

Use the content of these files to populate the issue title and body.
The title should be derived from the proposal title.
The body should contain the summary, motivation, and a checklist of tasks.

**Important**: Please append a "References" section at the bottom of the issue body.
This section must list the relative paths to the provided context files (proposal, design, detailed-design, tasks, specs).
Format them as a Markdown list.

If possible, use the @github participant to create the issue directly.
Otherwise, provide the title and body for me to create it manually.
